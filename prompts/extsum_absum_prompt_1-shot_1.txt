Create an extractive summary with the 3-5 most important sentences of the following dialogue and number the sentences in order of appearance. 
Then, based on the extractive summary you just created, and the numbers you assigned to each sentence, create an abstractive summary (in your own words) of the dialogue. Each sentence of the abstractive summary will have exactly one of the tags described below. Also, each sentence should have a list of integers referencing to the extractive summaries' lines that support that sentence. 

TAG DEFINITIONS:
Customer:
1.	ISSUE: A problem the customer called for
2.	FEEDBACK: transmission of evaluative or corrective information about a product or process given by the client
Agent:
3.	RESOLUTION: Agentâ€™s action where the customerâ€™s issue is directly resolved.
4.	RESOLUTION STEP: Agentâ€™s action that takes a step towards a RESOLUTION 
5.	DEFLECTION: Agentâ€™s action to redirect the issue into another platform (either direct messaging, email or calling the same or another agent)
6.	WORKAROUND: Agentâ€™s suggestion that deals with a problem without completely solving it
